'''
Pythonâ€™s zip() function is defined as zip(*iterables). 
The function takes in iterables as arguments and returns an iterator. 
This iterator generates a series of tuples containing elements from 
each iterable. 
zip() can accept any type of iterable, such as files, lists, 
tuples, dictionaries, sets, and so on.
